Hi, I am Senalyst. Welcome to my little virtual working space. I have opened up this space to keep track of where I head toward in the midst of technological flood and to share personal experiences as a Korean living in Seattle and as a software engineer in tech industry. You can peek my daily lives in Seattle on the above menu `blog`, my previous projects on `projects`, and all sort of software engineering knowledge, including but not limited to programming languages(mainly Go), kubernetes, service mesh(istio), cloud(AWS/GCP) on `technology`.

세널리스트의 작업 공간에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 기술의 홍수 속에서 길을 잃지 않기 위해, 그리고 시애틀 지역 개발자로서 느낀 개인 경험들을 공유하고자 이 공간을 열게 되었습니다. 시애틀 지역 내 일상의 이야기들은 주로 `blog` 에서, 그간 해온 크고 작은 개발 프로젝트는 `projects` 에서, 그외 개발 업무를 하면서 배운 programming languages(Go), kubernetes, service mesh(istio), cloud(AWS/GCP) 등의 지식들은 `technology` 에서 보실 수 있습니다.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --> -->
